Welcome to the Solidity++ Lesson series. In this series of lessons we will learn to develop a complete dApp from the ground up.
- Learn the basics of the development environment.
- Learn how to deploy a smart contract to the mainnet.
Each lesson has both a video and a written guide, and both guides will show you everything you need to complete the lesson. The video guide is easier to follow, while the written guide has a lot of additional information that will help you learn Solidity++ in depth. Feel free to use either or both guides while working through the lessons.
