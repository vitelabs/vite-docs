# Smart Contract Development

Developing usable smart contracts using Solidity++ can roughly be split into two tasks, writing the contract and developing an interface.

### 1. Writing the Smart Contract.

Solidity++ is used to write the contract itself, which is then deployed onto the blockchain. Once a contract is deployed, anyone can interact with it, making the contract essentially a decentralized and publicly accessible application backend.

This can be done entirely within VSCode and the Solidity++ extension, following steps from the [debugger guide](./debugger/) and examples from [Simple Contracts.](./simple-contracts/)


### 2. Developing the interface.
There is a much greater freedom when it comes to developing an interface to interact with a smart contract. For starters, the platform can be anything: an Android App, an iPhone app, a website, a browser plugin, a command-line interface, a shell script, etc.

There are several tools available to help you build interfaces:
- Vite Labs has both a [JavaScript API](/vite.js/) and a [Java API](/vitej/) for interfacing with nodes/contracts.
- Using the [Solidity++ VSCode extension's debugger interface](./debugger/).
- Vite node [RPC calls](/api/rpc/) can be invoked directly.
- Wallet authentication through [ViteConnect](https://github.com/vitelabs/vite-connect-client) is also possible.

We cover some simple examples of [interacting with contracts](../tutorials/hello-world/) to get you started, but you'll want to supplement this guide with other resources for developing for your target platform.

### 1. Writing the Smart Contract.

Solidity++ is used to write the contract itself, which is then then deployed onto the blockchain. Once a contract is deployed, anyone can interact with it, making the contract essentially a decentralized and publically accessible application backend. Due to the limits on computation power, smart contracts are usually relatively simple in design, and developing a prototype can take a short time. The real challenge is ensuring that a contract performs all calculations and accounting extremely carefully to avoid loss or theft of any funds managed by the contract.

A few important things to keep in mind:

- **Contract address**
<br> When deploying your contract, you'll want to record the contract address. Even if multiple contracts are deployed with the same code, they store. For example, if you make a contract to handle crowdfunding donations, it's critical that donors know *your* contract's address.

- **Source code**
<br> You will want to make sure you keep a copy of the exact version of the source code used for each contract deployment. Moreover, any contract intended for public use should have the source code published. This allows the contract to be **verified** by comparing the on-chain code to the output generated by compiling the source.

### 2. Developing the interface.

There is a much greater freedom when it comes to developing an interface to interact with a smart contract.

This allows you to write a Android App, an iPhone app, a Website, a browser plugin, a command-line interface, a sophisticated curl script. You name it!
