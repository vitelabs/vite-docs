# Simple Contracts

In this section we will look at several simple contracts to introduce the basic syntax and features of Solidity++. It's fine if you don't understand something the first time you see it, as you read more examples you'll begin to pick things up.

<!-- IF YOU ADD AN ENTRY, UPDATE config.js -->
- [Hello World](./hello-world/)
<br> Simple contract demonstrating message listeners, logging using events, and sending funds.

- [Data Storage](./data-storage/)
<br> Introduces state variables, getter functions, and message passing between contracts.

- [Batch Transfer](./batch-transfer/)
<br> Demonstrates basic control flow, local variables, and parsing data arguments.

- [Guess The Secret](./guess-the-secret/)
<br> Our first use of mappings, abi functions, and hashing.

- [Quota Bank](./delegate-stake/)
<br> Shows how to call the built-in smart contract to obtain quota for given address.

- [Casino Game](./casino/)
<br> Introduces random number generation, structs, tokenID, and important modifiers (`memory`, `public`, `pure`).
