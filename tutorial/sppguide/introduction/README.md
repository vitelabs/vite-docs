# Overview

<img src="../solpplogo.svg" style='width: 30%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block' >

Solidity++ is a smart contract language derived from [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) that is used to create smart contracts on the [Vite](https://vite.org) blockchain. Solidity++ embraces Solidity’s underlying message passing infrastructure, allowing the language to be extended to an asynchronous design that is highly compatible with high throughput DAG-based blockchains like Vite.

## Solidity++ Features

- Based on Solidity. Easier to learn and to port existing contracts.
- Asynchronous design allows for high throughput on DAG-based blockchains.
- Secure by default against reentrancy and flash-loan attacks
.

- Support for native tokens, random numbers, scheduled tasks and more.
- Vite's feeless ecosystem and Quota system enable new possibilities for dApps.

## This Guide

This guide is designed for aspiring smart contract developers. You're expected to have some basic programming knowledge, but previous Solidity/Solidity++ experience is not needed.

The goal of this guide is to have you writing contracts and deploying your own dApps as quickly as possible, so **we will not cover some important details of the underlying Vite architecture**. Once you complete this guide, there is much more to learn through reading the [Vite documentation](https://docs.vite.org).
