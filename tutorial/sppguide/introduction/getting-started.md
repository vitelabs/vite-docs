While you can jump to any section that interests you, this guide is also designed to be read section by section using the links at the bottom of each page.

Here are some highlights:
- The [installation guide](./installation/) will walk you through installing the Solidity++ development environment and deploying your first contract.

- Our [smart contract overview](../basics/) gives the high-level approach to developing a smart contract in Solidity++, as well as a guide to the tools needed to interact with deployed contracts.

- Our collection of [simple contract examples](../basics/simple-contracts/) and explanations gives a quick feel for the language.

- See our [tutorials](../tutorials/) for step-by-step guides and videos for developing a dApp from scratch.

- Additional resources can be found on our [quick reference](../reference/) page, as well as a useful [cheat sheet](../reference/cheat-sheet/) that gives a brief summary of all Solidity++ syntax.
