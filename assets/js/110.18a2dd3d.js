In regards to what components should be decentralized, and to what degree of decentralization an exchange should achieve, there is no common understanding in the industry, and the actual implementation of the exchange reflects the architect’s view of decentralization, flexibility, performance, and trade-offs between them. As a firm practitioner of DEX, ViteX’s mission is to build an exchange of the best decentralization, leading to a hybrid approach of fully decentralized core components and, in order to take into account flexibility and user experience, a few centralized non-critical sub-systems.

The smart contract guarantees that no VX will be released ahead of schedule.\nIn December 2019, over 70m VX were burned according to the new emittance curve, through a special interface of the contract.

In stake mining, the balance change caused by staking or un-staking is tracked in the dexFund contract. Similar to stake mining, trade mining tracks the change of transaction fees while referral mining will calculate the cumulative rewards of both inviter and invitee in the contract too. At the end of a mining cycle, the dexFund contract executes the relevant mining algorithm to calculate the proportion of mined VX in total for each mining account and credit VX to the account.\nThe total mined VX of liquidity mining in each cycle will first be sent to a temporary account in dexFund, and then an off-chain service will call the dexFund contract to distribute VX from the temp account to individual mining accounts.
