In the meantime, a small amount of quota is consumed from the developer’s account to trigger the deployment transaction.\n— Cost of calling a contract: Due to the asynchronous architecture adopted by Vite’s smart contract, both transactions of request (triggering the contract) and response (executing the contract) consume quota.
