# VEP-10: Vite TestNet-PreMainnet Data Migration Plan

## Background

Due to massive optimizations made in blockchain's data structure and consensus algorithm, old transaction data cannot be verified in the mainnet. Therefore, transactions in TestNet will not be retained after the migration, but only account status will be.

## Objectives

1. Keep complete account state information
2. Ensure consensus works smoothly when the mainnet launches

## Migration Plan

Generate a genesis block on each account involved to store balance, contract states and other information that should be migrated. Then snapshot these genesis account blocks into a genesis snapshot block.

### User Account 

User account status includes account balance and un-received transactions.
* Balance is directly saved
* Amounts of all un-received transactions are summed up and added into account balance
* Only balances of **VITE** and **VCP** are retained

### Contract Account

Contract account status includes contract information (code, delegated consensus group that the contract belongs to), contract states (contract storage), contract account balance and un-received transactions.

#### Built-in Contracts

* Balance is directly saved
* Amounts of all un-received transactions are returned to original accounts
* Only balances of **VITE** and **VCP** are retained

Staking contract (address `vite_0000000000000000000000000000000000000003f6af7459b9`)
* Retain all staking information with new expiration height 1 (can be retrieved immediately after the mainnet launches)

Original SBP registration contract, voting contract and consensus group contract are merged into new consensus group contract (address `vite_0000000000000000000000000000000000000004d28108e76b`)
* Retain all valid SBP registrations with new registration expiration height 7776000 (about 3 months after mainnet launches)
* Retain all voting information
* Retain all settings in snapshot consensus group and public delegated consensus group

Mintage contract (address `vite_000000000000000000000000000000000000000595292d996d`)
* Retain token information for **VITE** and **VCP**
* Change **VITE** to re-issuable
* For other tokens, token issuance fee (1,000 VITE each) is refunded to issuer's account and the relevant token will not be retained

#### User-deployed Contracts

* User-deployed contracts will not be retained
* Contract deployment fee (10 VITE each) is refunded to contract creator
* Contract balance is returned to contract creator
* Amounts of all un-received transactions are returned to original accounts
* Only balances of **VITE** and **VCP** are retained

## Conclusion

* Consensus state is carried over from TestNet. The snapshot consensus group info and SBP ranking is unchanged
* Account information remain unchanged, including balance, staking, voting, SBP registration and token issuance information
* All user-issued tokens need to be re-minted in the mainnet
* All user-deployed smart contracts need to be re-deployed in the mainnet
