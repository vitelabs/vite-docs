# Contract

## Create Contract

Basically, creating contract is sending a transaction (transaction type = 1) by specifying contract's binary code and parameters. This process has the following steps.

1. Call RPC method `contract_createContractToAddress` to generate a new contract address;
2. Encode constructor's input parameters according to ABI. This can be done by calling method `abi.encodeParameters` provided in **vite.js**. If the constructor has no input parameter, skip this step;
3. Generate transaction data. The data content consists of a prefix of 14 byte length (10 byte consensus group id + 1 byte contract type + 1 byte response latency + 1 byte random degree + 1 byte quota multiplier), compiled code and encoded constructor parameters (generated in Step 2).
4. Build account block, then call RPC method `ledger_sendRawTransaction` to create contract. Here parameter `toAddress` is the contract address generated in Step 1. `data` is transaction data created in Step 3. Choose `blockType` = 1, indicating creating contract transaction. Set `amount` and `tokenId` as the amount of the token that will be transferred to the contract upon creation. `fee` is always 10 VITE, which is the cost of creating contract on Vite network.

:::tip Tips
Above steps are implemented in method `builtinTxBlock.createContract` in **vite.js** 
:::

Parameter description:

* **Delegated consensus group id**: The response blocks of contract chain are produced by the supernodes of delegated consensus group that the contract has registered for. One available consensus group at the time being is public consensus group, which has id `00000000000000000002`.
* **Contract type**: Using 1 to indicate Solidity++ contract.
* **Response latency**: The number of snapshot blocks by which request sent to the contract has been confirmed before responding to the specific transaction. The value ranges from 0 to 75. 0 means there is no waiting period and respond block will be produced immediately. If either timestamp, snapshot block height, or random number is used in the contract, the value must be bigger than zero. Generally speaking, larger response latency means slower contract response and response transaction will consume more quota.
* **Random degree**: The number of snapshot blocks having random seed by which request sent to this contract is confirmed before responding to the specific transaction. Value range is 0-75. 0 indicates that there is no waiting for the request transaction to be included in a snapshot block that contains random number. If any random number related instruction is used in the contract, the value must be above 0. In general, the larger the value, the more secure the random number. **This parameter must be no greater than response latency.**
* **Quota multiplier**: This parameter defines x times of quota is consumed for requested transaction when the contract is called. Quota charged on contract response transaction is not affected. The value ranges from 10 to 100, which means 1-10x quota should be consumed. For example, a value of 15 means that the requested transaction to the contract is charged 1.5x quota.

## Call Contract

Calling a smart contract is to send a special transaction to smart contract's address, specifying method name and passed-in parameters. 

1. Encode method name and passed-in parameter as ABI interface defines. This step can be done by calling `abi.encodeFunctionCall` method in **vite.js**
2. Build transaction block and call RPC method `ledger_sendRawTransaction` to send the transaction to contract. Herein `toAddress` is the contract address and `data` is transaction data created in Step 1. `blockType` is set to 2. `amount` and `tokenId` stand for the amount of token that are transferred to the contract. `fee` is 0, indicating no transaction fee.

:::tip Tips
Above steps are implemented in method `builtinTxBlock.callContract` in **vite.js** 
:::

## Read States Off-chain

Contract's states can be accessed off-chain through `getter` methods. The ABI definition of `getter` method and off-chain code are generated when the contract is compiled. 

1. Encode off-chain method name and passed-in parameter as ABI interface defines. This step can be done by calling `abi.encodeFunctionCall` method in **vite.js**
2. Call RPC method `contract_callOffChainMethod` to query contract states

## Call Built-in Contract

Calling built-in contract is to send a special transaction to built-in contract's address, specifying calling method name and passed-in parameters. 
Vite has provided 3 built-in smart contracts: Quota, Token Issuance and Consensus.

1. Encode method name and passed-in parameter as ABI interface defines. This step can be done by calling `abi.encodeFunctionCall` method in **vite.js**
2. Build transaction block and call RPC method `ledger_sendRawTransaction` to send the transaction to built-in contract.

Methods of built-in contracts are provided in `builtinTxBlock` in **vite.js**
